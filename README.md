# CUDA-GL
A library that was meant to be a replacement for glm inside a project that require CUDA, that was later transformed into more like of a linear algebra library with CUDA support than a library for OpenGL.

Compiling error from the glm, combine with how lazy I was to fix the error, born this library.
