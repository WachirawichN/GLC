# CUDA-GL
A library that was meant to a replacement for glm inside a project that require CUDA, that was later transformed into more like of a linear algebra library with CUDA support than a library for OpenGL.

When I compile my project the glm gave I error that said I need atleast CUDA version 7.0, even though I have 12.8, and with how lazy I'm to bother fixing that error, this library was born.
